Goldae,@AlyssaSpears I'm sorry.   Maybe walking around all goofy at the store would help...HINT HINT! &lt;3
Goldae,"Getting changed in the hopes that, that means we can go to the store now!  Poor cat is out of food...oops. "
Goldae,@pilvlp My luck I'd probably get stopped by a cop or something stupid!  
Goldae,@pilvlp I don't think I can find a way to convince Mom to drive that far out of her way.   Maybe you should call her and ask!  
Goldae,@mileycyrus I love having my feet on the dashboard!  But I guess it is in the line of sight of the person driving. 
Goldae,Anyone got a teleporter I could borrow right quick?? Really missin' my Baby hardcore right now.    
Goldae,"Wow, I've been awake 2 hours and haven't accomplished anything. "
